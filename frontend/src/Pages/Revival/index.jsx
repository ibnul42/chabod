            There is a now a whole new wave of prayer in our land. There are
            prayer conferences, concerts of prayer, prayer rallies, and prayer
            seminars. Entire denominations have entered a “year of prayer.” May
            it all increase with the increase of God!Nothing I suppose is more
            prayed about or more needed than Revival. Nor is anything more
            promised in Scripture. Yet our praying seems to be so little
            answered.

          <p className="font-semibold">
            Most of the praying sounds as if Revival is always “going to be.” We
            constantly hear the phrase, “when Revival comes.” But when? Why
            aren’t we expecting Revival now? Because we do not expect it now, we
            futurize and generalize and procrastinate it.Praying for Revival is
            not the same as Revival-Praying. Our land has never been more needy
            and God knows it calls for a spiritual Revival. However, while we
            keep sending up petitions for our land, Jesus is saying,“What about
            your churches?”Revival is for God’s people. It’s not a call to the
            White House but to God’s house. We want a landside while we let our
            churches backslide. It’s like praying for a forest fire to get our
            fireplaces going. We say Revival is all in God’s hands, while we let
            our prayer meetings get out of hand and die.

          Hearts and Ears For Revival

          <p className="">
            The book of Hebrews warns against hardness of heart, and the book of
            Revelation warns against being hard of hearing. In Revelation
            chapter one, the Lord is blasting a trumpet so loudly that all of
            the Seven Churches (meaning any and every church) are to hear it,
            wake up, repent, be revived, and get on fire for God. Then, as if
            that were not enough, He lifts up His voice with the roar of the
            Niagara with the same message, while He walks in the midst of those
            churches. Finally, the Holy Spirit also penetrates our eardrums
            seven times with the same words to every one of those Seven
            Churches: “He that has an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit
            says to the seven churches.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it! All these are siren-like voices, and we pay little or
            no attention to them. We don’t even seem to hear them!
          </p>
          <p>
            So we wait for Christ’s second coming to take us out of a miserable
            world, while he is blasting his bassoon for us to wake up, awaken
            our churches, and get on fire for God in this miserable world!

            Are we waiting for the coming of the Lord to do what His Spirit
            wants to do now?
          </p>
          <p>
            The coming of the Holy Spirit with power in our churches is not only
            needed for the evangelizing of the world—it is also the best
            preparation for the coming of the Lord. Nothing makes us more ready
            for heaven than living in the heavenlies now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The message on the coming rapture is never more wonderful than in a
            Revival of the church.
